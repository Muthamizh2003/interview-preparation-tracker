Minimum steps to destination
Difficulty: MediumAccuracy: 31.77%Submissions: 43K+Points: 4
Given an infinite number line. You start at 0 and can go either to the left or to the right. The condition is that in the ith move, you must take i steps. Given a destination d, find the minimum number of steps required to reach that destination.

Example 1:

Input: d = 2
Output: 3
Explaination: The steps taken are +1, -2 and +3.
Example 2:

Input: d = 10
Output: 4
Explaination: The steps taken are +1, +2, +3 and +4.
Your Task:
You do not need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function minSteps() which takes the value d as input parameter and returns the minimum number of steps required to reach the destination d from 0.

Expected Time Complexity: O(sqrt(d))
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)

Constraints:
1 â‰¤ d â‰¤ 10000
