Kth Missing Positive Number in a Sorted Array
Difficulty: MediumAccuracy: 60.89%Submissions: 9K+Points: 4
Given a sorted array of distinct positive integers arr[], we need to find the kth positive number that is missing from arr[].  

Examples :

Input: arr[] = [2, 3, 4, 7, 11], k = 5
Output: 9
Explanation: Missing are 1, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10… and 5th missing number is 9.
Input: arr[] = [1, 2, 3], k = 2
Output: 5
Explanation: Missing are 4, 5, 6… and 2nd missing number is 5.
Input: arr[] = [3, 5, 9, 10, 11, 12], k = 2
Output: 2
Explanation: Missing are 1, 2, 4, 6… and 2nd missing number is 2.
Constraints:
1 <= arr.size() <= 105
1 <= k <= 105
1 <= arr[i]<= 106

class Solution {
    public int kthMissing(int[] arr, int k) {
        // code here
        int left=0,right=arr.length-1;
        while (left <= right) {
            int mid=left+(right-left)/2;
            int missingCount=arr[mid]-(mid+1);
            if(missingCount<k)
            {
                left=mid+1;
            } else {
                right=mid-1;
            }
        }
        return k+right+1;
    }
